Introduction
============

This tool provides a simple interface to LIBSVM, a library for support vector
machines (http://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~cjlin/libsvm). It is very easy to use as
the usage and the way of specifying parameters are the same as that of LIBSVM.

Installation
============

On Unix systems, we recommend using GNU g++ as your
compiler and type 'make' to build 'svmtrain.mexglx' and 'svmpredict.mexglx'.
Note that we assume your MATLAB is installed in '/usr/local/matlab',
if not, please change MATLABDIR in Makefile.

Example:
        linux> make

To use Octave, type 'make octave':

Example:
	linux> make octave

On Windows systems, pre-built 'svmtrain.mexw32' and 'svmpredict.mexw32' are
included in this package, so no need to conduct installation. If you
have modified the sources and would like to re-build the package, type
'mex -setup' in MATLAB to choose a compiler for mex first. Then type
'make' to start the installation.
(在Windows系统上，预建'svmtrain.mexw32'和'svmpredit.mexw32“是包含在本软件包中，因此无需进行安装。
如果你已修改源，并希望重新生成包，在MATLAB中键入mex-setup中选择一个编译器。然后键入“make”开始安装。)

Starting from MATLAB 7.1 (R14SP3), the default MEX file extension（文件扩展名） is changed
from .dll to .mexw32 or .mexw64 (depends on 32-bit or 64-bit Windows). If your
MATLAB is older than 7.1, you have to build these files yourself.

Example:
        matlab> mex -setup
        (ps: MATLAB will show the following messages to setup default compiler.)
        Please choose your compiler for building external interface (MEX) files: 
        Would you like mex to locate installed compilers [y]/n? y
        Select a compiler: 
        [1] Microsoft Visual C/C++ version 7.1 in C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio 
        [0] None 
        Compiler: 1
        Please verify your choices: 
        Compiler: Microsoft Visual C/C++ 7.1 
        Location: C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio 
        Are these correct?([y]/n): y

        matlab> make


Under 64-bit Windows, Visual Studio 2005 user will need "X64 Compiler and Tools".
The package won't be installed by default, but you can find it in customized
installation options.

Usage使用
=====

matlab> model = svmtrain(training_label_vector, training_instance_matrix [, 'libsvm_options']);

        -training_label_vector:
            An m by 1 vector of training labels (type must be double).
        -training_instance_matrix:
            An m by n matrix of m training instances with n features.
            It can be dense or sparse (type must be double).
（训练标签的m×1的向量（类型必须为double））
（具有n个特征的m个训练实例的m×n矩阵。它可以是稠密的或稀疏的（类型必须是double））
        -libsvm_options:
            A string of training options in the same format as that of LIBSVM.
（一系列与LIBSVM格式相同的训练选项）

matlab> [predicted_label, accuracy, decision_values/prob_estimates] = svmpredict(testing_label_vector, testing_instance_matrix, model [, 'libsvm_options']);

        -testing_label_vector:
            An m by 1 vector of prediction labels. If labels of test
            data are unknown, simply use any random values. (type must be double)
        -testing_instance_matrix:
            An m by n matrix of m testing instances with n features.
            It can be dense or sparse. (type must be double)
        -model:
            The output of svmtrain.
        -libsvm_options:
            A string of testing options in the same format as that of LIBSVM.

Returned Model Structure
========================

The 'svmtrain' function returns a model which can be used for future
prediction.  It is a structure and is organized as [Parameters, nr_class,
totalSV, rho, Label, ProbA, ProbB, nSV, sv_coef, SVs]:

        -Parameters: parameters
        -nr_class: number of classes; = 2 for regression/one-class svm
        -totalSV: total #SV
        -rho: -b of the decision function(s) wx+b
        -Label: label of each class; empty for regression/one-class SVM
        -ProbA: pairwise probability information; empty if -b 0 or in one-class SVM
        -ProbB: pairwise probability information; empty if -b 0 or in one-class SVM
        -nSV: number of SVs for each class; empty for regression/one-class SVM
        -sv_coef: coefficients for SVs in decision functions
        -SVs: support vectors

If you do not use the option '-b 1', ProbA and ProbB are empty
matrices. If the '-v' option is specified, cross validation is
conducted and the returned model is just a scalar（标量）: cross-validation
accuracy for classification and mean-squared error for regression.（分类的交叉验证精度和回归的均方误差）

More details about this model can be found in LIBSVM FAQ
(http://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~cjlin/libsvm/faq.html) and LIBSVM
implementation document
(http://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~cjlin/papers/libsvm.pdf).

Result of Prediction
====================

The function 'svmpredict' has three outputs. The first one,
predictd_label, is a vector of predicted labels. The second output,
accuracy, is a vector including accuracy (for classification), mean
squared error, and squared correlation coefficient (for regression).
（用于分类的精度、均方误差以及用于回归的平方相关系数）
The third is a matrix containing decision values or probability
estimates (if '-b 1' is specified). If k is the number of classes,
for decision values, each row includes results of predicting
k(k-1)/2 binary-class SVMs. For probabilities, each row contains k values
indicating the probability that the testing instance is in each class.
Note that the order of classes here is the same as 'Label' field
in the model structure.
第三个是包含决策值或概率估计的矩阵（如果指定了“-b 1”）。如果k是类数，对于决策值，
每行包括k（k-1）/2个二元类SVMs的预测结果。对于概率，每行包含k个值，表示测试实例在
每个类中的概率。
请注意，这里的类顺序与模型结构中的“Label”字段相同。

Examples
========

Train and test on the provided data heart_scale:

matlab> load heart_scale.mat
matlab> model = svmtrain(heart_scale_label, heart_scale_inst, '-c 1 -g 0.07');
matlab> [predict_label, accuracy, dec_values] = svmpredict(heart_scale_label, heart_scale_inst, model); % test the training data

For probability estimates, you need '-b 1' for training and testing:

matlab> load heart_scale.mat
matlab> model = svmtrain(heart_scale_label, heart_scale_inst, '-c 1 -g 0.07 -b 1');
matlab> load heart_scale.mat
matlab> [predict_label, accuracy, prob_estimates] = svmpredict(heart_scale_label, heart_scale_inst, model, '-b 1');

To use precomputed kernel, you must include sample serial number as
the first column of the training and testing data (assume your kernel
matrix is K, # of instances is n):

matlab> K1 = [(1:n)', K]; % include sample serial number as first column
matlab> model = svmtrain(label_vector, K1, '-t 4');
matlab> [predict_label, accuracy, dec_values] = svmpredict(label_vector, K1, model); % test the training data

We give the following detailed example by splitting heart_scale into
150 training and 120 testing data.  Constructing a linear kernel
matrix and then using the precomputed kernel gives exactly the same
testing error as using the LIBSVM built-in linear kernel.

matlab> load heart_scale.mat
matlab>
matlab> % Split Data
matlab> train_data = heart_scale_inst(1:150,:);
matlab> train_label = heart_scale_label(1:150,:);
matlab> test_data = heart_scale_inst(151:270,:);
matlab> test_label = heart_scale_label(151:270,:);
matlab>
matlab> % Linear Kernel
matlab> model_linear = svmtrain(train_label, train_data, '-t 0');
matlab> [predict_label_L, accuracy_L, dec_values_L] = svmpredict(test_label, test_data, model_linear);
matlab>
matlab> % Precomputed Kernel
matlab> model_precomputed = svmtrain(train_label, [(1:150)', train_data*train_data'], '-t 4');
matlab> [predict_label_P, accuracy_P, dec_values_P] = svmpredict(test_label, [(1:120)', test_data*train_data'], model_precomputed);
matlab>
matlab> accuracy_L % Display the accuracy using linear kernel
matlab> accuracy_P % Display the accuracy using precomputed kernel

Note that for testing, you can put anything in the
testing_label_vector.  For more details of precomputed kernels, please
read the section ``Precomputed Kernels'' in the README of the LIBSVM
package.

Other Utilities
===============

A matlab function libsvmread reads files in LIBSVM format: 

[label_vector, instance_matrix] = libsvmread('data.txt'); 

Two outputs are labels and instances, which can then be used as inputs
of svmtrain or svmpredict. 

A matlab function libsvmwrite writes Matlab matrix to a file in LIBSVM format:

libsvmwrite('data.txt', label_vector, instance_matrix]

The instance_matrix must be a sparse matrix. (type must be double)
These codes are prepared by Rong-En Fan and Kai-Wei Chang from National
Taiwan University.
